There is an issue with running the function in a container. Somewhere along the way we did not implement the KRM function correctly.

I ran this command: 
```sh
kustomize build --enable-alpha-plugins --enable-exec --network --enable-helm examples/argocd
```
and got this error:
```
failed to evaluate function: error: function failureError: couldn't execute function: exit status 1
```

This means either:
- the dockerfile is not properly set up
- the cli entrypoint is not properly set up
- the main entrypoint is not properly set up
- or some combination of the above

Requirements: 
- Do not make any changes until we know what the problem is. 
- read the README.md carefully and follow any links related to how krm functions work
- do your homework and fully understand how krm functions are implemented
- study the cmd/function/main.go file, is this how it should be? 
- note this the annotations using the image
```yaml
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: my-system
  annotations: 
    config.kubernetes.io/function: |
      container: 
        image: kubed/krm-helm-fn:latest
```

Use the render-helm-chart files as a reference implementation using the following tremplate and list to get all the files:
template: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kptdev/krm-functions-catalog/refs/heads/master/functions/go/render-helm-chart/<file>
files:
- main.go
- helmfn/helmchartprocessor.go
- Dockerfile
- README.md

Report back with your finding on where the problem is in the code.
